'Descriptin:    This module is suppossed to be a global loan repayment schedule
'               that receives a loanno as a sole parameter and returns the principal and interest for that month
'               taking care of three loan repament methods. (STL,RBA and ARMT)
'Note: this should stop any other loan calculation in other module throughout the project
'       it's designed to work with easysacco
